# PySpark Pandas Examples

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts designed to illustrate the powerful integration and usage of the **Pandas API on Apache Spark**. These examples showcase how data professionals can leverage familiar **Pandas-like syntax** for highly scalable and distributed data processing, bridging the gap between local data manipulation and big data environments.

## File Descriptions

Here's a brief description of what each of your Python files does, highlighting their use of Pandas in Spark:

- **`pandas-api.py`**  
  Demonstrates the core functionalities of the **Pandas API on Spark**. It shows how to create a Pandas-on-Spark DataFrame and perform familiar Pandas-style operations like:
  - Calculating means  
  - Generating summary statistics  
  - Filtering data  
  - Adding new columns  
  All while leveraging **Spark's distributed processing power**. It also illustrates conversions between Pandas-on-Spark and native Spark DataFrames.

- **`pandas-transform-apply.py`**  
  Focuses on **advanced data manipulation** using `.transform()` and `.apply()` methods within the Pandas API on Spark. It shows how to:
  - Apply element-wise operations with `.transform()`  
  - Use `.apply()` on both columns (e.g., categorizing data) and rows (e.g., formatting data based on multiple columns)  
  for more complex transformations.

- **`pandas-conversion.py`**  
  Highlights the **seamless interoperability** between standard Pandas DataFrames, Spark DataFrames, and Pandas-on-Spark DataFrames. It demonstrates how to:
  - Convert data between these different DataFrame types  
  - Perform operations in each environment  
  - Convert them back  
  Showcasing the **flexibility of using Pandas with Spark**.

## Conclusion

These examples provide a practical foundation for understanding and utilizing the **Pandas API on Spark**. By exploring these scripts, users can gain insights into performing scalable data analysis with a **familiar interface**, making the transition to **big data processing more intuitive**.
